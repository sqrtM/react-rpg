cute little project i wanted to do to work on some of the stuff ive been learning with react.

dcss is top 5 games of all time for me; ascii rpgs are cool. always wanted to make one.

im purposefully doing this very naively. not looking at any tutorials and looking up as little as possible in general.
not because i think that will make a better product, obviously, but i've been learning for a while and wanted to test myself and
see what i could do just on my own for the moment.

things i have
1. working, manipulable room (now, less of a room, more of an open world! wow!)
2. enemies which die and disappear [while perserving their location and data!!]
3. UI which tracks whats going on
2. environmental colors (red for blood, yellow for treasure, blue for water, etc.). this could pretty easily be done in SCSS programatically.
2. enemy "AI" (basic. just "find player x and y position and randomly choose one of those distances to shorten every turn" for now).


things i want (semi-to-do list, semi-asperational thoughts list. not in order)
1. when website is pulled up, a screen where the player chooses their name, race, and class is shown (probably text based; i.e., "type ORC for ORC".).
1. dungeons. like, something you can enter on the overworld, go into, then leave again. would be cool.
2. different enemy types.
3. environmental hazards (water, lava, fire, etc).
5. XP and basic leveling system
6. weapons
7. magic
8. scrolls and books

another idea i've always wanted in a game like this is having enemies whose speed is based on player stats (a la DCSS),
but also enemies whose speed is REAL time, giving you incentive to take different stategic approaches with different enemy types.

(for example, it could really lend itself well to a scary, high-tension moment if you were running away from a monster who took a turn
every, say, 2 seconds regardless of your stats. an interesting use-case for this could be if you were in a dungeon of some kind and you read signs that say "ohh, beware of the scary monster" or whatever. then, when you take the treasure, the room caves in and a monster wakes up. you then have to hope your dig stat is fast enough to get you out of the room before the monster reaches you in, say, 15 real-world seconds. could be interesting! i always thought a tiny, tiny touch of real-time action could spice up something like DCSS. maybe this is one way of doing so.)

we'll see where we go from there.

thanks!
