cute little project i wanted to do to work on some of the stuff ive been learning with react.

dcss is top 5 games of all time for me; ascii rpgs are cool. always wanted to make one.

im purposefully doing this very naively. not looking at any tutorials and looking up as little as possible in general.
not because i think that will make a better product, obviously, but i've been learning for a while and wanted to test myself and
see what i could do just on my own for the moment.

things i have
1. working, manipulable room (now, less of a room, more of an open world! wow!)
2. enemies which die and disappear [while perserving their location and data!!]
3. UI which tracks whats going on
2. environmental colors (red for blood, yellow for treasure, blue for water, etc.). this could pretty easily be done in SCSS programatically.
2. enemy "AI" (basic. just "find player x and y position and randomly choose one of those distances to shorten every turn" for now).


things i want (semi-to-do list, semi-asperational thoughts list. not in order)
1. when website is pulled up, a screen where the player chooses their name, race, and class is shown (probably text based; i.e., "type ORC for ORC".).
1. dungeons. like, something you can enter on the overworld, go into, then leave again. would be cool.
2. different enemy types.
3. environmental hazards (water, lava, fire, etc).
5. XP and basic leveling system
6. weapons
7. magic
8. scrolls and books

we'll see where we go from there.

thanks!
